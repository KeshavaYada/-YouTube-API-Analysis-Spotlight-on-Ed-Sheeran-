- This pattern could reflect a strategic release schedule to maximize audience engagement during these months.

### 7. Correlation Between Views, Likes, and Comments
- There is a strong correlation between view count and like count, as well as between view count and comment count. Videos with higher views tend to also have higher likes and comments, which is typical of popular content.
- The scatter plots demonstrate that a small number of videos (e.g., ‚ÄúShape of You‚Äù) significantly outperforms others in both views and engagement metrics.
